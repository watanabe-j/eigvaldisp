Description: Statistics of eigenvalue dispersion indices of
    covariance and correlation matrices---common measures of
    phenotypic integration in biometrics.
    The primary feature is to calculate expectation and variance
    (i.e., sampling bias and error) of eigenvalue dispersion indices
    for arbitrary population covariance structures under multivariate normality.
