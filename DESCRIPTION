Description: Statistics of eigenvalue dispersion indices of
    covariance and correlation matrices, common measures of
    phenotypic integration in biometrics, based on
    Watanabe (2022) <doi:10.1111/evo.14382>.
    The primary feature is to calculate expectation and variance
    (i.e., sampling bias and error) of eigenvalue dispersion indices
    for arbitrary population covariance structures under multivariate normality.
